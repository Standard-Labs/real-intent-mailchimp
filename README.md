# Real Intent's Mailchimp Tool

This tool helps you process lead data and integrate it with Mailchimp. It provides a convenient way to split leads by email address, assign tags based on intent categories, and either download a Mailchimp-compatible CSV or send the leads directly to Mailchimp.

## Features

- **Upload Lead CSV**: Upload your Real Intent CSV file.
- **Normalize Emails**: The tool normalizes the leads into one row per email address, splitting leads with multiple emails into separate rows.
- **Email Filtering**: You can choose to exclude leads with no email address.
- **Tag Mapping**: Automatically tags leads with a mapping of your choice based on the lead's Intent Categories.
- **Download CSV**: Once the CSV is prepared, you can download the file for manual upload to Mailchimp.
- **Send to Mailchimp**: Or directly send the tagged leads to a Mailchimp list in your account.
